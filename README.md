Northeastern Neo-Aramaic consists of a very diverse group of Aramaic dialects that were spoken until modern times in Northern Iraq, North West Iran and South Eastern Turkey by Christian and Jewish communities. These are among the last remaining living vestiges of the Aramaic language, which was one of the major languages of the region in antiquity.

This text corpus consists of transcribed and recorded texts gathered by [Prof. Geoffrey Khan](https://www.ames.cam.ac.uk/people/professor-geoffrey-khan) and his team in their efforts to preserve these increasingly endangered languages. The corpus is encoded in [Text-Fabric format](http://github.com/annotation/text-fabric) for the purpose of aiding ongoing linguistic research. Linguistic annotations are to be added throughout the project.
